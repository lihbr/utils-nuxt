`@lihbr/utils-nuxt.*` are helpers I use across my [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) projects. To achieve that purpose they are designed to be as agnostic as possible, although being quite opinionated.

## Packages

<d-alert type="warning">

Those packages just got migrated to actual packages and are still pre-major version (`v1.x.x`). I'll most likely refactor them before releasing a first major and allow myself to publish breaking changes while doing so, therefore if you want to use them as is I highly recommend watching out when upgrading their versions.

Also feel free to inspire from them, [submit feedback or questions](https://github.com/lihbr/utils-nuxt/issues/new), or fork this repository~
