Those packages are hosted on [GitHub npm Registry](https://github.com/features/packages). In order to install them, you will have to tell your node package manager to fetch them there and to be authenticated to GitHub's registry. This can be achieved through a simple `.npmrc` file ([documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/npmrc.html)) that you can version at the root of your repository:

```apacheconf[.npmrc]
@lihbr:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

These lines simply tell your package manager, either Yarn or npm, to fetch packages under `@lihbr` scope from GitHub's registry instead of npm's, and to authenticate to it using the value of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable has to be a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) of yours, with, at least, the `read:packages` scope.
